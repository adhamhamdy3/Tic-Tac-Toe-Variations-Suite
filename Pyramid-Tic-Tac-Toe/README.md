# Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description  
**Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe** is a creative variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game board takes the shape of a **pyramid**, adding a new layer of strategy to the traditional gameplay.  

### Game Board Layout  
The pyramid board consists of:  
- **5 squares** in the base row.  
- **3 squares** in the middle row.  
- **1 square** at the top.  

Players take turns marking **X** and **O** on the board, aiming to achieve three-in-a-row.

### How to Win  
- The game is won by getting **three-in-a-row**:  
  - **Vertically**  
  - **Horizontally**  
  - **Diagonally**  

If no player achieves three-in-a-row and the board fills up, the game ends in a **draw**.
